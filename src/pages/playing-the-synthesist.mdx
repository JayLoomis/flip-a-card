# Playing the Synthesist

The [Synthesist](/cards/synthesist) is the "creative". They are leaders, planners, organizers, makers. Given pieces, they make a working whole. Given a mystery, they unravel it. Given a problem, they provide a solution. Give individuals, they make a team.

The Synthesist is going on a grand adventure to _rearrange the world for the better_. Their ability to organize or create gives them a chance to put broken things back together.
