# Using Conditions

Many RPGs need a way to keep track of how hurt or inconvenienced the PCs are at the moment. Condition cards can do this, but they also serve other roles. Here's some ways to use the condition cards in your game.

* The fighter wants to attack a target, but doesn't have another card they want to flip for success. They can take an outcome like "Broken" or "Hurt", trading injury to themselves or their weapons to buy a successful hit.
* The prophet is leading the way through the wilderness and needs to meet a challenge to get out. They take "Weakened", saying that they've been sharing their rations and water with the others to get everyone a little further.
* The thief wants to buy some new equipment in town, but can't find what they need. They can take the "Obliged" condition to obtain it from a crime-lord, who now has an interest in how they're using it.
* The healer who has already been "Mutated", being partially turned demonic by a curse, aggravates their condition to "Transformed" to meet a challenge. Rather than spending a single scene cleansing themselves of their taint, they must now spend some significant amount of downtime being brought back.
* The monk who's been blind from birth doesn't have the "Hindered" condition card - they've learned to live as they are. However, their bardic companion who depends on their voice to sing would become Hindered if they overtaxed their singing ability in battle, or during a vital performance.
