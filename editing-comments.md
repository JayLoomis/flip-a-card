## What's the game about?
I know that what you're creating is a flexible framework. That said, I think it
would really benefit from more prescription about the kind of play experiences
that you're envisioning that it produces. The cards as written are operating on
a lot of assumptions that players know how to do this roleplaying thing, and I
think that's going to be a barrier to it seeing play.

I encourage you to think about these questions as you continue to develop and
playtest:

-   What does playing this game _feel_ like? Does it encourage free-wheeling,
    high-energy action? Quiet, vulnerable character scenes?
-   Do the cards stay in the forefront during play, or do they fade to the
    background to make room for something else (ropleplaying, tactical decision
    making, etc.)?
-   Are there particular genres or moods that the game handles particularly well?
    Any that it handles poorly?

## Need more info about the core rules
I don't get very much clarity about how the game is supposed to play from the
core rule cards. My biggest question is: who can flip cards, when, and how often?

Let's look at The Facilitator. If the no facilitator side is showing, we work
things out collectively. But it also says to flip it to become the facilitator.
So if we're discussing how to resolve something and I don't like what you're
saying, it would seem that I can flip the card to just dictate what I want. Of
course, you can just flip it back, so where does that leave us? Maybe you want
the dynamic of a breakdown if we can't play nice, but it feels to me like some
more structure would be welcome. Maybe we only flip core rule cards at key
moments in play like between sessions or encounters. Maybe there's something to
limit how often one person can flip a core card like some currency or something.
