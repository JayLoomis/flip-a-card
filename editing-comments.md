## What's the game about?
I know that what you're creating is a flexible framework. That said, I think it
would really benefit from more prescription about the kind of play experiences
that you're envisioning that it produces. The cards as written are operating on
a lot of assumptions that players know how to do this roleplaying thing, and I
think that's going to be a barrier to it seeing play.

I encourage you to think about these questions as you continue to develop and
playtest:

-   What does playing this game _feel_ like? Does it encourage free-wheeling,
    high-energy action? Quiet, vulnerable character scenes?
-   Do the cards stay in the forefront during play, or do they fade to the
    background to make room for something else (ropleplaying, tactical decision
    making, etc.)?
-   Are there particular genres or moods that the game handles particularly well?
    Any that it handles poorly?

## Need more info about the core rules
I don't get very much clarity about how the game is supposed to play from the
core rule cards. My biggest question is: who can flip cards, when, and how often?

Let's look at The Facilitator. If the no facilitator side is showing, we work
things out collectively. But it also says to flip it to become the facilitator.
So if we're discussing how to resolve something and I don't like what you're
saying, it would seem that I can flip the card to just dictate what I want. Of
course, you can just flip it back, so where does that leave us? Maybe you want
the dynamic of a breakdown if we can't play nice, but it feels to me like some
more structure would be welcome. Maybe we only flip core rule cards at key
moments in play like between sessions or encounters. Maybe there's something to
limit how often one person can flip a core card like some currency or something.

## Comments about the cards and card formats
So far, I'm noticing three distinct types of cards:

-   _Toggles_ between states. Each side gives the rules for one of the states and 
    gives instructions to flip the card to switch to the other state.
    
-   _Dual natures_ that represent something that has some characteristics that are
    generally positive and some that are generally negative. One side lists some
    of the positives, the other lists some negatives.
    
    Dual natures are prompts. When you demonstrate the charcteristics of the face-up
    side in the game, you can flip the card. I assume, but haven't seen it explicitly
    stated, that flipping one of your character cards in this way implicitly gives
    you a _hit_.
    
-   _Severity_ of a situation. Condition cards are the prototypical example. One
    side describes a moderate mitigating situation. The other side describes a
    more severe version of the same situation.
    
    Severity cards are introduced and flipped in response to mechanical or
    fictional events. E.g. you get hit by a sword, so you get the wounded card.
    Later you get patched up by your cleric and you discard the card. So the
    typical flow of these cards (in a complete cycle) is: 
    
    ```
    out of play -> side A -> side B -> side A -> out of play
    ```
    
    I assume that the facilitator (if there is one) makes the call about when
    these cards are introduced, flipped, and removed. Otherwise we arrive at those
    actions by consensus.
    
### Toggle cards
Toggles are flipped arbitrarily (as far as I can tell, see my questions about
core rules cards). The two sides are neutral and equivalent--that is, one side
isn't more or less desirable from an in-fiction standpoint.

The current format for toggles is to have the same title on both sides with the
body text describing the states. I recommend that you change this to title each
side to indicate the current state. For example, instead of having a card entitled
_The Facilitator_ on both sides with clarifying text, have a card that says
something like "We make decisions together" on one side and "I make the decisions"
on the other. There are going to be a lot of cards on the table, and the easier it
is for everyone to quickly take in the current state, the better.

For toggle cards, it doesn't really make sense to call one side the front and one
the back. Obviously, you'll use those terms behind the scenes in the data, but to
the players, both sides should be equal. Unless you want to set up an explicit
default state.
