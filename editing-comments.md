## What's the game about?
I know that what you're creating is a flexible framework. That said, I think it
would really benefit from more prescription about the kind of play experiences
that you're envisioning that it produces. The cards as written are operating on
a lot of assumptions that players know how to do this roleplaying thing, and I
think that's going to be a barrier to it seeing play.

I encourage you to think about these questions as you continue to develop and
playtest:

-   What does playing this game _feel_ like? Does it encourage free-wheeling,
    high-energy action? Quiet, vulnerable character scenes?
-   Do the cards stay in the forefront during play, or do they fade to the
    background to make room for something else (ropleplaying, tactical decision
    making, etc.)?
-   Are there particular genres or moods that the game handles particularly well?
    Any that it handles poorly?

### Why this game?
I find myself asking this question a lot as I review. I don't mean it to be
unhelpfully provacative, but I feel like asking it might get us somewhere.

In your answer to my question about audience, you said you were filling a niche
that shares characteristics with yourself. A fine answer. Making a game for
someone you don't intuitively understand can be tough. But as I review what you've
got I am wondering what about this game is solving problems that you've got. I've
heard you on multiple occasions express a preference for games where you have a
clear, mechanical definition of your character's abilities so that you know what
to expect them to be able to do in the game. That's conspicuously absent here
From my perspective, you've made a game where what your character is capable of is
less important than that they find some kind of trouble for each aspect of
themselves half of the time. That's not bad by any means, but it feels more like
something designed for me than for you, so I'm curious to learn how you connect
to that dynamic (or whether I've got the vibe of the game all wrong somehow).

## Need more info about the core rules
I don't get very much clarity about how the game is supposed to play from the
core rule cards. My biggest question is: who can flip cards, when, and how often?

Let's look at The Facilitator. If the no facilitator side is showing, we work
things out collectively. But it also says to flip it to become the facilitator.
So if we're discussing how to resolve something and I don't like what you're
saying, it would seem that I can flip the card to just dictate what I want. Of
course, you can just flip it back, so where does that leave us? Maybe you want
the dynamic of a breakdown if we can't play nice, but it feels to me like some
more structure would be welcome. Maybe we only flip core rule cards at key
moments in play like between sessions or encounters. Maybe there's something to
limit how often one person can flip a core card like some currency or something.

## The flexibility in the core rule cards might work against you
When I read through the core rule cards, the flexibility you built into the game
with things like facilitator and challenge make it clear that you want this to
be a framework, but they also make it hard for me as someone who wants to play to
figure out how to play the game. My opinion is that you might have more success
getting people into the game if you have clear defaults for some of these things.
There's no reason you can't put some of these fundamental play things on cards,
but I think it might be a better move to to offer them as examples about how to
change the system rather that an integral part of the base system. Just something
to think about. Something that I have odten talked about with Drew is that people
will tinker with a game once they get to know it, but that adding options to the
base experience can easily become a barrier to entry. Games stall out when players
are overwhelmed by the options. Small surface area with instructions and examples
of how to expand it fells like a better user experience to me.

## Comments about the cards and card formats
So far, I'm noticing three distinct types of cards:

-   _Toggles_ between states. Each side gives the rules for one of the states and 
    gives instructions to flip the card to switch to the other state.
    
-   _Dual natures_ that represent something that has some characteristics that are
    generally positive and some that are generally negative. One side lists some
    of the positives, the other lists some negatives.
    
-   _Severity_ of a situation. Condition cards are the prototypical example. One
    side describes a moderate mitigating situation. The other side describes a
    more severe version of the same situation.
    
### Toggle cards
Toggles are flipped arbitrarily (as far as I can tell, see my questions about
core rules cards). The two sides are neutral and equivalent--that is, one side
isn't more or less desirable from an in-fiction standpoint.

The current format for toggles is to have the same title on both sides with the
body text describing the states. I recommend that you change this to title each
side to indicate the current state. For example, instead of having a card entitled
_The Facilitator_ on both sides with clarifying text, have a card that says
something like "We make decisions together" on one side and "I make the decisions"
on the other (this is quick, not very good example, not a suggestion of actual
names). There are going to be a lot of cards on the table, and the easier it is
for everyone to quickly take in the current state, the better.

For toggle cards, it doesn't really make sense to call one side the front and one
the back. Obviously, you'll use those terms behind the scenes in the data, but to
the players, both sides should be equal. Unless you want to set up an explicit
default state. Which is a different discussion.

### Dual nature cards
These are the cards that, IIRC, you first pitched to me and Drew when you were
coming up with the game. In that way, they feel to me like the core of the game.

_Opportunist_, c. 1/23/2020, is a great example. The front side of the card has
prompts for behaviors that are pretty universally positive, while the back side
has prompts to push you to show us a darker facet of that trait.

It isn't entriely clear from your current materials how these are supposed to
work. Here's how I think they work (maybe my assumptions and vague recollections
will be helpful):

-   You can flip a card to score a hit by introducing one of the prompts into the 
    fiction (or a related one that the Facilitator buys off on).
-   Back side actions come with complications of some kind.
-   I presume:
    -   You can narrate anything on either side whenever it makes sense, but it 
        ony scores you a hit if it's on the face-up list.
    -   These cards flip back and forth without limit, as long as you use a
        prompt to make it happen.
        
These cards make the most sense to use the _top side_/_flip side_ terminology.
In this context, I think _flip side_ is a perfect term. I'm less sold on top side,
though I haven't given a ton of thought to what might make the intended meaning
clear (_face value_?). There's a definite light side/dark side vibe to what I
think are the best examples of these cards.

### Severity cards
Severity cards are introduced and flipped in response to mechanical or
fictional events. E.g. you get hit by a sword, so you get the wounded card.
Later you get patched up by your cleric and you discard the card. So the
typical flow of these cards (in a complete cycle) is: 

```
out of play -> side A --(worsens)--> side B --(improves)--> side A --(improves)--> out of play
                  |
                  --(improves--> out of play
```

I assume that the facilitator (if there is one) makes the call about when
these cards are introduced, flipped, and removed. Otherwise we arrive at those
actions by consensus. Though, I now see from your overview that you can also 
choose to take one, as a player, to score a hit for your character.

For these cards, some name for the sides makes sense. The _top side_ / _flip side_
taxonomy doesn't really fit. It's almost like the _bad_ side and the _worse_ side.

It's not clear to me what happens if you have a condition on the worse side and
the fiction dictates that it gets even worse. Does that knock you out of the action?
Or does it give you an even more fictionally severe condition?

### Other cards
There are more kinds of cards than those three, but they tend to make less sense
to me conceptually. I'll post issues with my questions about those.
