    name: Courage
    desc: |-
      //"It doesn't matter if I win. It matters if I don't try." -- Emory
      Courage is strength in the face of grief or pain. It's not just a willingness to do something, but to do it when there's every reason to hold back.
      Courage lets you fight when afraid, speak when being shouted down, stand up when you're injured, or take an unpopular stand.
    prompts:
      - Honor or pride must be upheld
      - Someone or something near you has already suffered harm
      - Nobody else can or will take the risk

    name: Courage
    desc: |-
      //"Emory! Fall back! This isn't our fight!" -- Tana
      Not every risk has to be taken, nor is every reward worthwhile. Sometimes, you do things it would have been better not to do.
    prompts:
      - Expose yourself to unnecessary danger
      - Seek glory or self-aggrandizement
      - Take chances for the thrill of it

    name: Charm

      //"I only come to this tavern to see you!" -- Basler
      The essence of charm is creating a bond with someone. Make them feel interesting, or appreciated, or just part of something cool.
      Charm lets you awe, wow, surprise, or comfort people. It gets you through tough situations with style and panache, making people move aside for you or get behind you through force of personality.
    prompts:
      - Perform with grace and elegance
      - Get by on audacity
      - Gain someone's confidence

      //"Listen, city boy. Stop talking or I'll cut your tongue out." -- Woody
      Some people can become enraptured by their own ability to impress and influence. They buy into the story they're selling, until reality intrudes.
    prompts:
      - Show off needlessly
      - Push things for the sake of pushing
      - Take advantage of someone's emotions

      //"I don't know, I just felt ... something ... flow through me!" -- Tana
      The mystical, the eldritch, the arcane. The Power has many names. When called, it always comes. That doesn't mean you can always command it.
      Magic lets you achieve a variety of supernatural outcomes, with costs and consequences that sometimes don't make rational sense.
    prompts:
      - Place the impossible within reach
      - Mingle the material and the symbolic
