      You've been affected by a temporary problem. Injury, delirium, debts, magical curses, and so on are all conditions.
      You can choose to take a condition to get a hit. Describe how. Any player offering a challenge can suggest an appropriate condition that meets that challenge.
      The condition is true and limits your fictional actions. If you narrate an action the condition would interfere with, you must meet the challenge of the condition in addition to any other challenges.
      You can flip a topside condition to worsen it and get another hit. Describe how.
      Clearing conditions takes time. Use this time to drive drama, build the world, or explore how you clear the condition.
