      You've been affected by a temporary problem. Physical injury, mental disorder, social problems, magical curses, and so on are all conditions.
      The condition is true within the fiction until cleared. If you have a condition card, and you narrate an action the condition would interfere with, you must meet the challenge of the condition.
      You can take a condition to meet a challenge. Any player offering a challenge can suggest an appropriate condition.
    prompts:
      - "Take a new condition to get a hit"
      - "Flip topside to flipside to worsen the condition and get a hit"
      - "Topside: discard after spending a scene attending to the condition"
      - "Flipside: discard by spending downtime attending to the condition"
